          <p class="text" style="color: black;">
            Everyone loves learning new words, but how many of these do you know
            or use? Although brand new words won’t come up in course books or
            classic novels, teaching your students interesting new vocabulary
            can be fun and lead to great topical conversations in English.
            What’s more, it can help them develop their vocabulary learning
            strategies. It’s also possible that students will come across these
            new words in films, TV shows or on the street, so check them out and
            see how you can introduce them to your class.

          <p class="topic">6 unique ways to teach English</p>
          <p class="text">
            As the year comes to an end it’s a good idea to think of exciting
            new ways to engage our learners after the holidays. Students often
            spend this time with their friends and family, and studying English
            is often the last thing on their minds. It’s wise to have something
            interesting and fun ready to engage them again when they get back to
            the classroom in the new year. From incorporating technology and
            social media into your classes to using rap songs, we are sure
            you’ll find something you can use in this post.

            There are many real-life situations where you have to state your
            opinion, e.g. a friend asks you for advice, your boss wants to hear
            your opinion on a business matter. In English lessons, this is also
            a popular way of testing your English writing skills.
            
          </div>
          <div class="comment">
            <div class="icon">H</div>
           
            Just about every teacher agrees: report card comments are important.
            But there are few who actually look forward to writing them. Why?
            Because every instructor knows working under tight deadlines to
            create upwards of 20 unique and detailed reports isn’t exactly
            straightforward

          <div class="comment">
            <div class="icon">A</div>
            
            Somewhere around the halfway point to your deadline for report
            cards, you should take time at the end of each week to reflect — and
            jot down notes — about your students’ performance.
